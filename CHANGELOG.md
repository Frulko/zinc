# Changelog

All notable changes to Zinc are written here, for the people who use it. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (while the major version is 0, a minor version may break what the previous one ran). `make release`
moves the *Unreleased* section under the new version and publishes it as the release notes.

How to add a line: see "Changelog" in `AGENTS.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed (breaking)
- JSX is real JSX: write `className`, never `class`, and capitalised components (`<View>`, `<Text>`, `<Button>`, `<ScrollView>`, `<Image>`, `<Input>`).
  The engine refuses the old spelling with errors Z0006 and Z0007. Migrate a project with `zinc migrate --apply`.

### Added
- `zinc update` installs the new release by itself (checked against a signed manifest, the old engine kept for `zinc update --rollback`); a quiet daily notice says when a
  new version is out; the Atelier app has Help > Check for Updates. `zinc --version` now tells the real version.
- Two downloads per release: the `zinc` command line (`zinc-<version>-macos-<arch>.tar.gz`, nothing else to install) and the Atelier app (`Zinc-Atelier-<version>-macos-<arch>.zip`).
  `install.sh` installs the command line, `--atelier` adds the app.
- `zinc doctor` is a short, coloured check-up that tells what to do next; `zinc doctor --details` keeps the full report. On a Mac without the Xcode command line tools,
  `zinc build` offers to run `xcode-select --install`.
- `zinc lint` (also `--target` and `--all-targets`) warns before you build something a platform cannot run or cannot afford; `zinc migrate` rewrites old code for you.
- `--background` (or `ZINC_BACKGROUND=1`) opens a window without taking the focus.
- Hot compile mode for `zinc dev` (`import.meta.hot`); Android and iOS targets and profiles; an Android export; hello and the React Native showcase run on a Nexus 7.

### Fixed
- A method with a default parameter that a subclass overrides received `null` for it (`new EventTarget().addEventListener('x', fn)` crashed).
- A program run as a standalone app on macOS saw extra arguments in front of its own.
- The camera simulator did not compile on a machine without libgphoto2, so the camera examples failed there.
- Solid component props that read signals now follow them; the touch marks are off by default (`ZINC_TOUCHES=1` shows them).
- The web export of programs that use asset groups, storage or device features no longer stops at start.
